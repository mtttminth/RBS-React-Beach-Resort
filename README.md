Reach Beach Resort project tutorial by John Smilga from React Tutorial and Projects Course

I built this projects while learning react and this project covers mostly about react components,states,context and filters.
I've currently changed the site into black and white(dark) theme then i added react datepicker from https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-datepicker
